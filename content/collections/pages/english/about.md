As long as the heteropatriarchy renders gender-based violence ubiquitous, normalised, and even mundane, the fight to end gendered-based violence is a daily one, and often seems neverending. So what leads someone to take the first step and enter this struggle? We all have a story to tell of how we joined the fight against gender-based violence. And as these stories are heard, it becomes ever more clear how necessary it is to fight. We also recognise that this path can get very lonely... a loneliness which is relieved to a great extent as we hear the stories of others who have been through and are still going through similar things to us.

So we are gathering anonymised, personal stories through this website and sharing them via social media, with the goal being both to sensitise people regarding the urgent need to join in the fight against gender-based violence, and also to strengthen those who are already in the fight.

whywefight.gr is an initiative of the [Feminist Autonomous Centre for Research](http://feministresearch.org). Through this action we wish to create a forum for reflection on how and why we enter this collective struggle. And if you are not already part of this fight, perhaps these stories can lend you the courage and a starting point for you to join. Each individual is a distinct source of inspiration, and together we may become the world in which we want to live.
